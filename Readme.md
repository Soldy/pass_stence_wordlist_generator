This is a simple passphrase guesser. The original idea is to gather the most commonly used words from a person's social network activities, categorize them, and build a word list for Hashcat. I plan to create a C version for improved performance. I was pleasantly surprised that the Python version worked on the first attempt, to break a BitLocker passphrase over 40 characters long successfully.
